### 2020 - 2022: Tahoe Tutoring

I had the pleasure of working for two academic years at [Tahoe Tutoring](https://tahoetutoring.com/){:target="_blank"}, a private tutoring company in Incline Village, NV that services students of all ages from
elementary school through college. I was responsible for providing private and group tutoring to local and remote students in a variety of subjects, predominantly mathematics, science and test prep. I worked with a wonderful team of coworkers, and had the chance to work with an excellent and diverse array of students. In developing personal relationships with students I was able to help better attend to their learning styles, and the while emphasizing intuitive and visual approaches towards problem solving.

### 2016 - 2019: Drahmann Center, Santa Clara University

During my undergraduate I worked for three years with the [Drahmann Center](https://www.scu.edu/drahmann/){:target="_blank"}, Santa Clara University's on-campus tutoring center. There I provided weekly tutoring in mathematics and physics to students from all grades. It was an interesting experience working with students at or above my age level.
