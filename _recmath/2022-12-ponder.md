### Problem Statement

We're on the hunt for valid [NYT Letter Boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed){:target="_blank"} squares which permit a unique two-word solution, drawn from a large word list initially containing 370,105 words.

### Preliminary Simplifications

Right away, we can remove some words from this word list, as the rules of the Letter Boxed puzzle dictate that words in a solution can't contain consecutive identical letters (as in "hello"), and must be at least three letters in length. Additionally, since we are looking for a Letter Boxed square containing exactly 12 letters, we can remove all words containing more than 12 unique letters.

After these removals, our word list contains 285,024 words, and we're ready to sort through it. I essentially used a brute-force search through all pairs of words in the word list, where the last letter of the first word is the same as the first letter of the second word. I worked in Python, and at the heart of my program is a dictionary data structure and a clever use of the ```set()``` function, as I'll illustrate now.

### The Search

In the course of our search suppose we encounter the pair of words ```"dog"``` and ```"grab"```. The essential information contained in this pair can be stored in one string, made of the sorted unique letters they have in common, in this case ```"abdgor"```. We can obtain this string with the following code:

```
concat = ''.join(sorted(set("dog"+"grab")))
# Output: concat = "abdgor"
```

We store this string as the key in a dictionary, whose corresponding value is an array containing the key's frequency, as well as copies as the two original words, to be used later to recover our solutions. At this point in our search, we would perform:

```
sol_dict[concat][0] = "dog"
sol_dict[concat][1] = "grab"
sol_dict[concat][2] += 1

# Output: sol_dict["abdgor"] = ["dog", "grab", 1]
```

Now suppose that later on in our search we encounter the pair ```"god"``` and ```"drag"```. Since these words contain the same essential information as ```"dog"``` and ```"grab"```, our dictionary would be updated to ```sol_dict["abdgor"] = ["god", "drab", 2]```: the ```2``` tips us off to the fact that the set of letters ```"abdgor"``` would not yield the kind of Letter Boxed square that we're looking for.

After we've searched through the entire word list, we simply iterate through the dictionary, and write to file those pairs of words with a corresponding frequency of ```1``` in their value array.

As a small caveat, the example above ignores the fact that we're looking for squares with exactly 12 letters. Thus, my program first checks to see if the length of the concatenated string (in our case ```"abdgor"```) is exactly 12 letters before adding it to the dictionary.

### The Solutions

Having taken precious few classes in computer programming, I'm no stranger to inefficient code, and having solved many Ponder This problems through brute-force techniques, am not one to shy away from a long runtime. This program is in no way an exception, taking almost an hour to run on my laptop! There are some Ponder This problems which yield only a single solution, but in this case our search turned up almost 250,000! Here are just a few of my favorites word pairs:

```
abashments, skywave
jailbreaker, reglorify
tearjerkers, subfestive
zygotes, subflush
```
All that remains is to choose a pair, and construct a valid Letter Boxed square. I was worried that this step would be challenging, but it's actually rather simple, and can be done either on the first try or with some easy trial and error. 

I rather liked ```zygotes, subflush```, and submitted the following Letter Boxed square to earn my name on the list of solvers:

Without prior knowledge, I know I couldn't find the two-word solution here - could you?

I really enjoyed reading Brian Rogers's series of instructional posts about solving the Letter Boxed puzzle in general, using a variety of abstract algorithms and data structures. Check out his blog [here](http://writeasync.net/){:target="_blank"}.
