### Problem Statement

The standard set of banknotes used in the US is the set $\\$=\\{1, 5, 10, 20, 50\\}$. In the literature such sets are known as $coin \text{ } systems$. The US coin system is $greedy$ because the greedy algorithm for change-making - building up to the total by using the largest possible bills first - will make change using the fewest total number of banknotes. We're looking for coin systems that exhibit a related property, which we'll call optimality. An $optimal$ coin system is one for which every possible change value can be made in exactly one way with the fewest number of banknotes. It's perhaps easiest to understand this property by seeing a coin system without it. Consider $\\$ = \\{1, 7, 10\\}$. The fewest number of banknotes needed to make change for \\$21 is 3, but there are two ways to do so: using three \\$7 bills, or using two \\$10s and one \\$1. As a small sidenote, we remark that all greedy coin systems are optimal, but the converse is not true.

So, we're looking for optimal coin systems, but before moving on we'll need a couple more definitions. A $representation$ in a given coin system is the set $R = \\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n\\}$, where $\alpha_i$ denotes how many of each banknote will be used to make a given value. Returning to our earlier example, the value \\$21 had two representations: $R_1 = \\{0, 3, 0\\}$, and $R_2 = \\{1, 0, 2\\}$. Finally, we'll have need to consider a more simplified representation, which we'll call a $footnote$, that only keeps track of whether or not a given banknote was used. A footnote is exactly like a representation, except that any non-zero elements in the set are replaced by 1s. Here's a table with some examples to help summarize these definitions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Coin System} & \text{Change Value} & \text{Representation} & \text{Footnote}\\
\hline
\{1, 5, 10, 20, 50\} & 54 & \{4, 0, 0, 0, 1\} & \{1, 0, 0, 0, 1\} \\
\hline
\{1, 5, 10, 20, 50\} & 92 & \{2, 0, 1, 4, 0\} & \{1, 0, 1, 1, 0 \}\\
\hline
\{1, 5, 10, 20, 50\} & 72 & \{2, 0, 1, 3, 0\} & \{1, 0, 1, 1, 0 \}\\
\hline    
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note how the change values of 92 and 72 yielded identical footnotes. We'll call such pairs of change values $congruent \text{ } pairs$. Using our new terminology, this month's problem is asking us to find a coin system with five banknotes, such that any two $di\hspace{-0.1em}f\hspace{-0.1em}ferent$ change values chosen in the range $\[0, 99\]$ will be congruent pairs with probability $0.04$. The US coin system has $188$ such congruent pairs, which gives us the following probability calculation:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\frac{\text{Number of Congruent Pairs}}{\text{Total Number of Change Value Pairs}} = \frac{188}{\binom{100}{2} = 4950} = 0.03\overline{79}.

\end{aligned}
$$

### The Search

We'll be performing a brute-force search over all coin systems of the form $\\$=\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$, where $1 = c_1 < c_2 < c_3 < c_4 < c_5 \le 99$. For each coin system, we first check whether or not it is optimal, and then perform our probability calculation, printing out solutions accordingly. The main difficulty in this search is in implementing the function ```is_optimal```, which takes as its input a given coin system, and returns, in addition to the boolean ```True/False``` if the given coin system is/is not optimal, the set of all footnotes for the change values in the range $\[0, 99\]$.

```
def is_optimal(cs):
  # Highest change value being considered
  V = 99
  # Number of coins in the given coin system
  notes = len(cs)  

  # Initializes the array of representations for a given coin system
  reps = [[0 for i in range(notes)] for j in range(V+1)]

  # The array min_notes stores the minimal number of banknotes for change value i
  min_notes = [100 for i in range(V+1)]
  min_notes[0] = 0

  # We initially assume the coin system is optimal
  optimal = True 
  # Loop over all change values 
  for i in range(1,V+1):
      if optimal:
          # Loop over all banknotes
          for j in range(notes):
              # If true, then banknote cs[j] can be used to make change value i
              if i - cs[j] >= 0:  
                  # If using the current banknote gives a rep using fewer notes
                  if min_notes[i-cs[j]]+1 < min_notes[i]:
                      optimal = True
                      # Updates the min_notes array
                      min_notes[i] = min_notes[i-cs[j]]+1
                      # Updates the representation array
                      reps[i] = reps[i-cs[j]].copy()
                      reps[i][j] = reps[i][j] + 1
                  # If in using the given note we tie our previous value
                  elif min_notes[i-cs[j]]+1 == min_notes[i]:
                      temp_rep = reps[i-cs[j]].copy()
                      temp_rep[j] = temp_rep[j] + 1
                      # If there are two distinct representations that use the same number of notes
                      if reps[i] != temp_rep:
                          optimal = False

  # Converts the representations to footnotes
  for i in range(V+1):
    for j in range(notes):
      if reps[i][j] != 0:
          reps[i][j] = 1

  # Returns 
  return optimal, reps
```

Overall, we are essentially implementing the dynamic programming solution to the oft-discussed [Coin Change problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coin-change-dp-7/){:target="_blank"}. We initialize an array to store our representations, as well as an array to store the minimum numbers of notes required for each change value. We build our ```min_notes``` array from the ground up, at each step asking if the incorporation of a new banknote leads to a representation with fewer notes. A non-optimal coin system would be flagged as such in the final conditional, which handles for circumstances like the $R_1 = \\{0, 3, 0\\} \ne \\{1, 0, 2\\} = R_2$ example above. Finally, we convert the representations to footnotes and return our variables.

The probability calculation is rather simple to implement:

```
# Calculates the desired probability
def prob_calc(fn):
  # Initializes the number of congruent pairs to zero
  n = 0

  # Loops combinatorically over all distinct pairs of change values
  for i in range(1,99):
      for j in range(i+1,100):
          if fn[i] == fn[j]:
              n += 1

  # Returns the desired probability
  return n/4950
```

And finally, we implement the exhaustive search as follows:

```
for i in range(2,97):
  for j in range(i+1,98):
    for k in range(j+1,99):
      for l in range(k+1,100):
      
        # The given coin system
        CS = [1,i,j,k,l]
        optimal, fn = is_optimal(CS)

        if optimal:
          if prob_calc(fn) == 0.04:
            # Our solutions
            print(CS)
```

### The Solutions

Thankfully, our programs terminates after a reasonable runtime of ~1 hour, and so we're not forced this month to improve our (horribly-inefficient) code. The fruits of our labor are 63 coin systems, each of which meets the probability condition. The first one we see is $\\$=\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 62\\}$, which is outputted quite quickly as it occurs early in our search space. Of note as well is the system $\\$=\\{1, 5, 10, 34, 50\\}$, which differs from the US system in only one banknote. Here's a link to [my code](/files/2019-09-ponder-code.txt){:target="_blank"}, as well as to the [list of solutions](/files/2019-09-ponder-solutions.txt){:target="_blank"} I was able to find.
