### Problem Statement

This month's problem is a continuation from the September 2019 problem, so be sure to first check out my writeup for that problem [here](https://wildernboyden.github.io/recmath/2019-09-ponder){:target="_blank"}. In the same vein as last month's problem, we're still considering optimal coin systems. This time, however, we're looking to $maximize$ a probability calculation. Recall from last time that the US coin system $\\$=\\{1, 5, 10, 20, 50\\}$ was found to have 188 $congruent \text{ } pairs$, which are pairs of change values like $92$ and $72$ which have identical $footnotes$, meaning that they use the same types of banknotes to make change, in this case ones, tens, twenties, and fifties. We're investigating the probability that two sets of change values are the same, given that they are congruent pairs. Since there are exactly $100$ ways to choose the same value from the range $\[0,99\]$, we're performing the calculation:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\frac{100}{2 \cdot (\text{Number of Congruent Pairs})+100} = \frac{100}{2 \cdot 188+100} \approx 0.21 

\end{aligned}
$$

Note that we defined congruent pairs to exclude the trivial case of identical change values, so we have to add them back into our calculation. Note as well that we have to double the number of congruent pairs, corresponding to the fact that the pair $(92, 72)$ is considered distinct from $(72, 92)$. Let's define the above calculation as the $congruence \text{ } probability$. Finally, this month's problem is asking us to find the coin system with five banknotes that maximizes the congruence probability.

### The Search (and the solution)

The only changes required to be made to last month's code are in the probability calculation, and in creating variables to store and update the current best coin system and congruence probability as we go along. Here's a link to [my code](/files/2019-10-ponder-code.txt){:target="_blank"}. After another ~1 hour runtime we arrive at the solution $\\$=\\{1, 2, 12, 16, 48\\}$, with an accompanying congruence probability of ~$0.29$.

### Visualizing the Search Space

Last month, we found 63 coin systems, all of which had 198 congruent pairs, and thus corresponding congruence probabilities of ~0.20. The solution to this month's problem, however, is unique. This prompted me to create a histogram of all possible coin systems, plotting the number of coin systems vs. the corresponding congruence probability. I ended up getting an interesting histogram, which I've included below. Be sure to click [here](/files/histogram-of-congruence-probability.jpg){:target="_blank"} for the zoomed-in version.
