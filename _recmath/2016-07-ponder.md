### Problem Statement

This problem asks us to generalize [Golomb's tromino theorem](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Tromino.shtml){:target="_blank"} to use [pentominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino){:target="_blank"}. For my solution, I submitted a short paper with two induction proofs and original graphics, which I typeset painstakingly (and foolishly!) in Word. Enjoy!
